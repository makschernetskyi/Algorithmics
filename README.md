# Algorithms ☄️

This repo contains some of the algorithms ⚗️ I have used and may need to write in the future 🔮.

## how the repo gets updated 🚀?

Usually it happens like this: I just have to write an algorithm ☄️ somewhere instead of using already written by someone implementation
or a library and sometimes I copy what I have written 👩‍💻, edit it a little and store it here😊.
